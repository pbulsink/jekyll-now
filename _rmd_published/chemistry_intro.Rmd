Along with playing around with hockey data, my real job is doing chemistry. Sometimes, this blog will contain work from that field, discussing tools I use or have written, papers that I find interesting, or other cool stuff. I say this, because I've started working on a few posts that will trickle out slowly interspersed in the hockey. To easily find these types of post, use the Tags feature, and look for 'chemistry'.
