Welcome to my blog! This will contain a mix of stuff, updated when I feel like it. Most of what will be here will be related to NHL hockey analyticss, or other programming projects in R, Python, or Java. 

This is a chance for me to learn Jekyll, which is new to me. 

I'll start with some back-posts of work, so nothing 'new' will be here for a bit. For example, in Winter 2015-2016 I did some predictions on the remainder of the NHL season, obviously with fresh data that won't be novel. 

Hopefully this goes well!
