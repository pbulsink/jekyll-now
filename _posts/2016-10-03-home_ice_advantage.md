While working on a new Elo rankings posts, I played around with data to determine a good value for home ice advantage (in terms of winning percentage). That value has changed drastically over the years, and I thought it was interesting, so I'd put it up here.

While the trend has tightened up recently, and seemed to settle near 0.55, it's interesting to see that in 1918-1919 the home ice advantage was 0.75, even though they played a 70 game season!
