Based on work that I did earlier, with collecting scores information and player data from [Hockey-Reference.com](www.hockey-reference.com), I've developed a small R package to help with this scraping... 
 
**HockeyScrapR**
 
<!--more-->
 
For the most part, this package simplifies three things: getting bulk score data for the history of the NHL, getting information on all of the players who have played in the league, and collecting the daily rosters from [dailyfaceoff.com](www2.dailyfaceoff.com). 
 
For more information, check the repo at [pbulsink/HockeyScrapR](www.github.com/pbulsink/HockeyScrapR), or read the `rOxygen2` pdf manual [here](https://github.com/pbulsink/pbulsink.github.io/raw/master/images/HockeyScrapR-manual.pdf).
 
I invite everyone to contribute, post feature requests, and identify bugs.
